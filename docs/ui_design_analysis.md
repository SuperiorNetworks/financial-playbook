## Why Not Toptal as Primary?

While Toptal designers are excellent, they're better suited as:
- **Supplementary inspiration** for specific components
- **Reference for edge cases** (e.g., unique chart types)
- **Backup option** if we need a specific pattern not found in Lazarev or Fuselab

The lack of cohesive documentation and unified design system makes them less ideal as a primary reference for a complete product.

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Foundation (Lazarev-inspired)
- Set up design system (colors, typography, spacing)
- Build navigation structure and page layouts
- Establish component library (buttons, forms, cards)
- Create professional, trustworthy aesthetic

### Phase 2: Dashboard (Fuselab-inspired)
- Implement customizable dashboard with React Grid Layout
- Build widget system (9 widgets)
- Create chart components (cash flow, trends)
- Add filter and search patterns

### Phase 3: Refinement (Both)
- Polish individual pages with Lazarev's attention to detail
- Enhance data visualizations with Fuselab's expertise
- Ensure consistency across all pages
- Add micro-interactions and transitions
